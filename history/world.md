- Americas: Maya city-states; later Aztec (Mexica) empire; Andes polities culminating with the Inca; sophisticated agriculture and road systems.

## Early Modern Transformations (c. 1400–1800)

- Maritime expansion: Iberian voyages; Columbus; Vasco da Gama; Pacific crossings. Columbian Exchange reshapes ecologies, diets, and populations.
- Atlantic systems: plantation agriculture; Atlantic slave trade and African diasporas; demographic and cultural consequences.

## Industrialization and Imperialism (c. 1800–1914)

- Industrial Revolution: mechanization, steam power, railways, factories; urbanization; new class structures; labor movements.
- Ideologies: liberalism, conservatism, socialism/communism, nationalism; feminist movements; abolitionism.
- New imperialism: Scramble for Africa; Asia’s treaty ports and spheres of influence; resistance and reform.
- Migration: transatlantic and intra-Asian migrations; indenture; settler colonialism; cultural exchange and conflict.

- Geopolitics and multipolarity: US, China, EU, India, regional powers; shifting alliances; new economic and technological competition.

## Cross-Cutting Themes

- Environment and disease: climate shifts, pandemics, ecological exchange shaping societies.
- Technology and knowledge: printing, gunpowder, navigation, industrial tech, computing, AI.

- Inequality and power: empire, slavery, capitalism; reform and revolution; human rights.
- Networks and exchange: trade routes (Silk, Indian Ocean, Atlantic), diasporas, migration.
